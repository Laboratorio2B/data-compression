## Data compression and compressed data structures

Lecturer: Giovanni Manzini,
Computer Science Dept. University of Pisa.


### Tentative lesson plan: 

1. Statement of the lossless data compression problem. Kraft inequality.  Order-0 Entropy. Optimal codes, Huffman codes and arithmetic coding (22/11).
2. Beyond order-0 Entropy: MTF + gamma codes. Order-k entropy. PPM algorithms (24/11).
3. LZ77 parsing: definition, bounds in terms of the order-k entropy. Burrows-Wheeler transform(27/11).
4. Introduction to compressed indices. Wheeler graphs (29/11)
5. (4/12)
6. (6/12)
7. (13/12)
8. (15/12)


**All lectures are 9am-11am in Sala Seminari EST (Room 351).** There will be no streaming or recording of the lectures. 
 


### There are two possible exam formats:

1. Students can present a problem/idea related to their research and show how it can take advantage of the techniques described in the course; this must include a working prototype of the suggested solution.

2. Students can present a related topic, not covered in the course, using materials provided by the instructors.
