## Data compression and compressed data structures

Lecturers: Giovanni Manzini, Paolo Ferragina. 
Computer Science Dept. University of Pisa.

### Tentative lesson plan: 

1. Statement of the Data compression problem. Main ideas beyond compression techniques: symbol substitution, phrase encoding, data transformations (16/5)
2. Measures of compressibility: entropy and beyond. Some optimality results and their meaning (17/5)
3. Burrows-Wheeler compression, Suffix array, introduction to compressed indices (18/5)
4. Rank and select operations. Wavelet trees and some applications (25/5)
5. Generalization of compressed indices: Wheeler graphs (26/5)
6. Compact representation of tree, graphs, and other structures (27/5)
7. Compressed indices for genomic datasets (30/5)
8. Learned data structures (31/5)

**All lectures are 9am-11am in Room 308 (Sala Polifunzionale)**
Streaming available on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/ajp-dqij-vvh). Lectures will not be recorded. 


### There are two possible exam formats:

a. students can present a problem/idea related to their research and show how it can take advantage of the techniques described in the course, possibly including a prototype of the suggested solution

b. students can present a related topic not covered in the course using materials provided by the instructors
